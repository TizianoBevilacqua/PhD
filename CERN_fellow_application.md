* Message for the hiring team

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Research Fellow position at CERN, as it aligns perfectly with my academic background, research interests, and career aspirations. As a PhD candidate already based at CERN, I have had the privilege of engaging with its dynamic research environment and collaborating with leading experts in the field. My current PhD project focuses on the study of Higgs boson production in association with heavy-flavor quarks, that I studied in the context of an Higgs+charm associated production analysis.

I would be eager to contribute my knowledge in this area while also learning from the wealth of expertise present at CERN. The prospect of collaborating with fellow researchers in such a stimulating and cutting-edge environment is particularly exciting to me.

My passion for physics, combined with my hands-on experience with the CMS experiment, has reinforced my commitment to advancing our understanding of fundamental science. This opportunity represents the ideal next step in my career—allowing me to apply my skills while continuing to grow as a researcher within an institution that already feels like home.

I would be delighted to further discuss how my experience can contribute to this position. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Tiziano Bevilacqua

* What is your motivation for applying for this job?

CERN stands as one of the most remarkable institutions in modern science, embodying excellence in fundamental research and international collaboration, making it the ideal environment to further my research in particle physics. My experience in the CMS experiment, particularly in Higgs boson studies and detector performance, has deepened my commitment to understanding fundamental interactions. As a Research Fellow, I aim to contribute to precision measurements of Higgs couplings and play an active role in detector advancements for the HL-LHC. The opportunity to collaborate with leading scientists while developing innovative analysis techniques aligns perfectly with my aspiration and career plans. I am eager to apply my expertise and grow within CERN’s dynamic and intellectually stimulating environment

* Describe the projects you have been involved with in respect to your main field of interest.
Include any relevant topics/technologies you have used.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked in neutrino physics as part of the CUORE and KATRIN experiments. My projects focused on designing and characterizing silicon detectors for cryogenic environments in CUORE and the TRISTAN upgrade of the KATRIN detector, gaining expertise in working with SiPMs and simulation tools like GEANT-4.

Currently, my research focuses on analyzing CMS data to study the Higgs-charm Yukawa coupling (yc), initially considered unobservable due to the challenge of identifying c-jets. I explore an alternative approach by probing yc at the production level, studying Higgs production in association with a charm quark. During my PhD, I contributed to the first analysis of yc in the H→γγ decay mode and developed a dedicated MC simulation in collaboration with theorists.
I am one of the main developers of HiggsDNA, now the primary tool for H→γγ analyses in CMS. Currently, I use it for a simultaneous measurement of H+b and H+c production, implementing dedicated multiclass MVA techniques to separate signal from both resonant and non-resonant backgrounds, enabling a more precise extraction of their contributions from well defined phase-space regions.

Additionally, I have contributed to CMS detector performance and calibration studies, analyzing Pixel tracker efficiency and cluster properties.
